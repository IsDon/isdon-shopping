ShoppingList and Cart basic application in Django / React

This is a simple first pass at a shopping list (from given json resource) which allows adding single or special deal amounts to a checkout, built as a seperate django app for interchangeability of each part.

## Installation

setup files in a directory
establish virtual environment <virtualenv> from parent folder recommended
in reactEx project folder:
npm install		(install npm packages from package.json)
pip install -r requirements.txt  (install pypi packages)
npm run server (runs 'python manage.py runserver')

## Usage

If you modify js, jsx or css, re-build with webpack, default config file in reactEx folder.    (shortcut is npm run build)

## Contributing

1. Really this is just an experiment for me - but if you want to take it further or use it for whatever purpose, go for it:   Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request, and I'll see about bringing it back in :D

## History
